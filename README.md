# Lights

A simple CLI tool for controlling hue lights.

You're sitting at your workstation and want to turn your hue lights on or off. Do you:

1. Pull out your phone and use the hue app / widget
1. Shout a spell to your google home / alexa
1. Get up and walk to your light switch

Wouldn't it be nice if you could run a command in the terminal you're already logged into? Now you can!

## Install

```
go get -u github.com/ozdanborne/lights
```

Alternatively, grab a precompiled binary from [the releases page](https://github.com/ozdanborne/lights/releases/latest) and add it to your `$PATH`.

## Usage

```
lights on
```
